# Movie-Recommendation-System

A content-based recommendation system. The algorithm recommends other movies similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions. The system takes into account id, title, overview, genres, keywords, crew and top 3 casts for recommendation. The details of the movies are fetched from TMDB. I have implemented Cosine Algorithm after the vectorization technique "Bag of Words". 

The system is integrated with Streamlit to convert it into a web app.

Softwares used:
ML model - Jupyter Notebook
IDE - PyCharm

Libraries and Toolkits used:
Python - NumPy, Pandas, pickle
ML - nltk (Natural Language Toolkit), sklearn (scikit-learn)
